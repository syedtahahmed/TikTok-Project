# TikTok Content Moderation Optimization

## Business Understanding
TikTok users can submit reports to flag videos and comments containing user claims, prompting moderation review. This process generates a substantial volume of reports, posing challenges for timely assessment. The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model to discern whether a video presents a claim or expresses an opinion. Successful implementation of this model would enable TikTok to streamline the review process, reducing the backlog of user reports and enhancing prioritization efficiency.

## Overview

### Goal
The primary objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model for classifying claims within the dataset.

### Tasks Done
1. Exploration and analysis of the dataset using Python.
2. Utilization of Tableau for data visualizations.
3. Conducting statistical testing.
4. Implementation of logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.

### Results
Both model architectures, random forest (RF), and XGBoost, demonstrated excellent performance. However, the RF model exhibited a superior recall score of 0.995, leading to its selection.
